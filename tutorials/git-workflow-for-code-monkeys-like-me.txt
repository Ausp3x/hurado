Typical workflow:

BEFORE

0. Navigate the terminal to the directory where you want the
    git repository to be.

1. Clone the repository to your local PC                           • git clone <copy-pasted-thing>
   (Copy paste the HTTPS or SSH from clicking the green "Code"
       button on the top-right of the github website)

    1a. Remember to enter the repository! :P                       • cd hurado


2. Fork the repository
    2a. Click the "Fork" button on the top right
         of the github website

    2b. After creating the forked repository, copy-paste the       • git remote add <fork-name> <copy-pasted-thing>
         link from the HTTPS or SSH button on the webpage
         of the forked repo

         <fork-name> can be anything you want, like "myName"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Fetch from the internet the changes made to the repo by others  • git fetch origin
2. Make a new branch                                               • git checkout -b new-branch-name
3. Add commits to this branch
    3a. Work work work until you feel you've completed some
         important piece of code.
    3b. Track all changes that you want to add to the next commit  • git add fileName / git add .
    3c. Create a new commit with all these changes                 • git commit -m "message describing this commit"
    3d. Rinse and repeat until you feel the task is done

4. Rebase (reroot) your branch to the most recent commit of main   • git rebase -i origin/master
    4a.  Resolve any conflicts                                     • git add fileWithConflict (after editing to resolve the conflict)
    4b.  Once all commits are resolved, continue the rebase        • git rebase --continue

5. Push your changes to github so that other people can see        • git push
    your branch!

(Then, a senior engineer will merge your branch)
Rinse and repeat!
